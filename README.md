# 👋 HI, I'M FERNANDO MORENO BORREGO!

## ABOUT ME

🎓 I hold a Bachelor's degree in Physics from Complutense University of Madrid and am currently pursuing a Master's in Big Data and Business Analytics at IE.

🌍 Based in the vibrant city of Madrid, I love exploring both bars and books skills when I'm not immersed in data.

📚 An avid reader, I enjoy delving into both technical books and science fiction novels.


## WHAT I AM WORKING ON

🔭 I’m currently working on projects involving large-scale data analysis and predictive modeling. This includes building robust data pipelines, developing machine learning models to uncover hidden patterns, and creating interactive dashboards using SQL, R, MATLAB, and Python. I'm particularly focused on applying these techniques to real-world business problems to drive actionable insights and enhance decision-making processes.
Bachelor's Project

During my Bachelor's, I developed a project on Geometric Brownian Motion aimed at modeling financial markets. The objective was to simulate stock prices and analyze their behavior over time, providing a statistical framework to predict future movements. This project deepened my understanding of stochastic processes and their applications in financial engineering.
